1) . What are Single Page Applications (SPA)?
A) Single page applications are web based applications that only need to be loaded once, with new functionality consisting of only minor changes to the user interface. It does not load new HTML pages to display the content of the new page, but rather generates it dynamically. This is made feasible by JavaScript's ability to alter DOM components on the current page. A Single Page Application method is speedier, resulting in a more consistent user experience.
